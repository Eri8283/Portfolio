                <div class="content">
                    My name is Eri Olaniran and I am 17 years old. My birthday is the 10th of September 2007. I am a DCU undergraduate student studying Computer Science. 
                    I know, Oh My God he looks like he is 15, but I am not okay? I just have a crazy baby face. I was born in Cavan.
                    I have 3 siblings: 1 older brother, 1 older sister and 1 younger sister as well as my 2 parents.
                    Interesting fact: I do not use Social Media.

                <div class="content">
                    My Work Experience is a very interesting topic in my opinion. Back in 5th year I was so desperate for money, I did an assistant job for the State Examinations Commision. My job was to help the super-intendent with whatever they needed.
                    The pay was not bad and at the time it was something I was proud of. It was somewhat of my first job.
                    Throughtout 6th year I kept looking for jobs and I tried applying on Indeed but that application is so useless.
                    I would say that I applied for atleast 100 jobs in total and only 5 replied back to me just for them to inform me that I did not get the job.
